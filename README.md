# Pico-ResTouch-LCD-2.8-Horizontal-Fix
An unofficial support for landscape orientation for Waveshare Pico ResTouch LCD 2.8" display.

Basically the 3.5" code slightly modified to make the 2.8" work.
I wrote this at like 2am.

Note that it's quite awful and the touch does not work properly when not in vertical orientation.
